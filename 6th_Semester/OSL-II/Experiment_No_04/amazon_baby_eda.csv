172,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I got this toy for my daughter when she was very little.  She really hasn\'t been interested until recently.  Now she loves to put little people inside the cars and look at them through the top.  She lets objects play hide-and-seek under the cars but she really doesn\'t stack them or nest them very much.  I think they are worth the money because they were fairly cheap but she hasn\'t really used them for the intended purpose.  I don\'t think I would buy them again but I certainly wouldn\'t take them back if they were given to me. I think my daughter will use them in different ways with other toys, in the tub or pool or even outside as she grows.

He can sit there for ten minutes just flipping the sunroof back and forth!  Go figure!  These cars are super sturdy and have taken quite a beating on our coffee table.  (They\'re in much better shape than the coffee table at this point.)  I love that they nest together so they don\'t take up too much space when they\'re put away.

177,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck\'s ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth.

When I would hold the vibrating setting on my kid would watch for a bit and even try it but just seemed bored with it and would move on. The yellow part also attracts dust and fiber out of the air like a magnet. It is ALWAYS dirty. I\'m not that particular when it comes to dirt and baby stuff but it grosses me out. It\'s also only wire clean, so it\'s a more high maintenance toy.",2,"i\'v tri thi for almost 6 month at differ point of our kid teeth and she\' just not that into this. it\' realli heavi for a baby. when i would hold the vibrat set on my kid would watch for a bit and even tri it but just seem bore with it and would move on. the yellow part also attract dust and fiber out of the air like a magnet. it is alway dirty. i\'m not that particular when it come to dirt and babi stuff but it gross me out. it\' also onli wire clean, so it\' a more high mainten toy."

At first she wasn\'t terribly interested in the toy, but then I took it and put it in my mouth and handed it back to her. She put it in her mouth, and I squeezed the other side to make it vibrate. The look on her face was priceless! Her eyebrows went up and I noticed she bit down harder (so I could let go), and she seemed to really like the vibration.

So far (he got this at 5 months) he can\'t always make the vibration happen himself but, 1)It\'s not that difficult for me to just push down on it as I\'m holding it for him since I like how it calms him down and 2) even when it doesn\'t vibrate, he still loves to chew away at it.  He has learned over time a bit better about how hard to bite down to make it go too and that it will go by chewing on any of the three available &#34;tips&#34; to the star.He also really likes the little spinning rattle on the end and it has little nibs that he likes to chomp on too (even though it is hard plastic and the star is rubber like).

270,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I had this very teether for my twin boys 8 years ago and they absolutely loved it.  So, when my new baby started teething, I sought out the same teether.  I was surprised when it arrived and the packaging stated that the product is, ""safety tested"" for BPA, lead, and phthalates.  It does not state ANYWHERE on the package that it is BPA free.  As a former regulator (of medical devices) I am very sensitive about company labeling and statements.  Perhaps too much so.  But, I would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned, and the lack of clear ""BPA free"" labeling on this product gives me pause.  Specifically, when they test it for BPA, lead, and phthalates, is there an acceptable amount allowed?!  If not, why wouldn\'t the company simply label the product as BPA, lead, and phthalate free?Eight years ago, when I gave this toy to my sons, no one had ever heard of BPA.  My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths, and I\'m sure it was all riddled with BPA.  But, in this day and age, when BPA is strongly suspected of being dangerous, I cannot in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that MAY contain it.  And, though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company TOLD them it was BPA free, I\'m still skeptical.  Again, why not label it as such?

312,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Ok - newsflash.  Diapers are just smelly.  We\'ve had this pail for 2.5 years now.  It was our first and primary one.  There were no major smell problems until after one year, when our son started eating solids.  Also, we change the bag twice weekly as 3 days is about the max for smell-containment.  Around 20-22 months we started shopping for a container that would be less smelly and didn\'t find one as good.  (We have a cheaper one upstairs which broke immediately and always stunk!)  We finally just put the Diaper Champ in the attic a few months ago and use the cheap one with the flip-up lid - mainly since the cheapo fits inside the cabinet and we didn\'t notice a big difference in smell-control.  (The most helpful action is to tie the dirty diapers inside a small plastic bag before putting them in the pail.)A couple of our friends have this pail and were pleased until the children started eating solid food and things got stinkier - but that\'s pretty much the consensus according to many reviews on the different pails.  I\'ve knocked off a star since the mechanism isn\'t that intuitive (to grandmothers and babysitters, at least) and it frequently gets stuck when the bag starts getting full.

The bag doesn\'t seal around the dirty diapers, so when it comes time to refill the bag, it\'s just like opening a regular trash can. Smells like the Champ is trying to knock YOU out with odor!2. The plastic seems to smell, ie. You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ.

317,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Two girlfriends and two family members put me onto this diaper pail.  They each had tried the Diaper Genie and had horrible results with eventual smells, and costliness of buying proprietary DG cartridges.  My family members eventually started bringing every dirty diaper out to the trash and leaving just wet diapers in the DG, that is until they found out about the Diaper Champ!Wow, what a difference, it seals in orders very well and using normal 8 - 13 gallon trash bags makes it economical.  The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child\'s point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.  Also, it needs to be away from the wall a little bit, so that it\'s flip top access lid locks into place and doesn\'t plop back down, but when engaged, the top will stay open so you can get at the bag of diapers within without having it fall onto your hand.We keep a little can of Oust nearby, spritz it before opening the top, grab the bag at it\'s neck to close off stinky odors, lift it out, twist it at the top and secure it with a twist-tie, and away we go to the garbage can.  And we take antibacterial wipes and run them around in the plunger area on both sides, voila, it\'s clean.At 3 months, we change the bag about 1 - 2 times a week.

Now, with my daughter at 1 year and eating lots of solids (and making really stinky diapers), I can happily recommend the diaper champ.  A couple suggestions: 1) as baby\'s poop gets stinkier, empty more often (at least once a week) and 2) every time you empty, spray with Lysol or similar product and wipe out with antibacterial cleaner.  This second step has kept the plastic from retaining a bad smell.I gave 4 stars because it\'s not ""perfect"" -- sometimes a little smell leaks out if it\'s very full.

The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.

320,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.  I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn\'t like the idea of having to buy special bags.  Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!! I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!No one has ever come to my house and noticed \'diaper odor.\'  In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son\'s diaper have been amazed at how the very \'potent\' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!  I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.  For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!  Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.

321,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I am so glad I got the Diaper Champ instead of the Diaper Genie!  You can use pretty much any plastic bag - even a grocery bag will do in a pinch.  My baby is 6 weeks and I have never smelled any odors at all from the Champ.  I especially like the way you close it - you just flip the handle and that\'s it.  The Champ is definitely the best.,5,i am so glad i got the diaper champ instead of the diaper genie! you can use pretti much ani plastic bag - even a groceri bag will do in a pinch. my babi is 6 week and i have never smell ani odor at all from the champ. i especi like the way you close it - you just flip the handl and that\' it. the champ is definit the best.
322,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,We had 2 diaper Genie\'s both given to us as a gift but it was hard to use it since everytime you stuff the diaper in you have to turn it which cannot be done with one hand (required if you are holding your baby).  Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.  On top of that the refills are very expensive.  So we decided to buy Diaper Champ and so far we love it.  It is very easy to use with one hand.  I like the feature that you can acutally clean the chute if for some reason it gets messy.  Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.  It is very easy to use and does not smell unless the bag needs to be replaced and the most important part is that you can use your regular garbage bags (no need for expensive refills).,4,we had 2 diaper genie\' both given to us as a gift but it wa hard to use it sinc everytim you stuff the diaper in you have to turn it which cannot be done with one hand (requir if you are hold your baby). also everytim you dispos your diaper it smell even when you are care to put the poopi diaper in a plastic bag befor disposing. on top of that the refil are veri expensive. so we decid to buy diaper champ and so far we love it. it is veri easi to use with one hand. i like the featur that you can acut clean the chute if for some reason it get messy. also it doe not smell everytim you dispos off the diaper but when you chang the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the onli down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but i can handl it and i love thi product and would recommend it to everyone. it is veri easi to use and doe not smell unless the bag need to be replac and the most import part is that you can use your regular garbag bag (no need for expens refills).
323,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"When shopping around for a diaper pail I was drawn to the Diaper Champ for several reasons. 1) I loved the idea of using regular plastic bags from the grocery store. 2) The one-hand chute is quick and easy to use while dealing with a squirming baby. 3) I\'d heard negative reviews about the Diaper Genie. Now that I\'ve had the Diaper Champ for 8 months, I\'m looking for a diaper pail that lives up to its name.About 2 months ago the chute began to stick and the pail began to release unpleasant fumes each time I\'d drop a diaper in. The inner lining had come loose and was preventing diapers from dropping down into the bag. Eventually, the lining just fell out and that\'s when the smell became unbearable. Not only is my daughter\'s nursery filled with odors strong enough to give you a headache, the smell is seeping into the hall and down the stairs.Our Diaper Champ is on its way to the recycle bin.

326,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"While pregnant with my son I reviewed all the diaper pails and found the diaper champ to be the most reasonable.  I liked the idea of no costly refills and it was only a couple more dollars than the diaper genie.  It was easy to put together, however it is difficult to open and empty.  My son is now 13 months old and the odor is noticeable.  Even the pail itself stinks regardless of how often I scrub it ( I even use scented trash bags).  With dirty diapers you do have to expect some smell, I mean it comes with the territory, however I have to keep an air freshner plugged into the wall to help combat the smell. It worked well for the first few months, but now I end up having to change the bags before they are even half full, which really seems like a waste.  I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.",3,"while pregnant with my son i review all the diaper pail and found the diaper champ to be the most reasonable. i like the idea of no costli refil and it wa onli a coupl more dollar than the diaper genie. it wa easi to put together, howev it is difficult to open and empty. my son is now 13 month old and the odor is noticeable. even the pail itself stink regardless of how often i scrub it ( i even use scent trash bags). with dirti diaper you do have to expect some smell, i mean it come with the territory, howev i have to keep an air freshner plug into the wall to help combat the smell. it work well for the first few months, but now i end up have to chang the bag befor they are even half full, which realli seem like a waste. i am now expect my second babi and am consid a differ pail thi time.if you are on a tight budget as i wa the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollar and the refills, i would defin spend the extra money."

341,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I chose the Diaper Champ over the Diaper Genie because of its money-saving feature of being able to accomodate most plastic bags with handles.  (The Genie requires use of their own bags.)  The plastic bags that work best are the larger kinds like the ones you get from Toys R Us or Ikea.  The plastic supermarket bags are a little too small.In regards to odor control, the DC has been successful for 3/4 of the year.  There is a noticeable smell during the summertime, so I\'ve had to change the bags more frequently on hot days or else face the consequence of suffering the aroma of baking poop.My only negative comment about this product is concerning the lid.  For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.  Even though I have short, uncared for nails, I\'ve had a few bent nails from trying to pull open the lid.  Then, the next problem is that the lid doesn\'t open all the way (like a cigarette lighter).  It opens up to about a 75 degree angle.  This makes it inconvenient when you are trying to remove a stuffed bag of diapers.  Also, the underside of the lid has several plastic sharp juttings against which my hands would occasionally get scratched.  And, during the removal of the full bag, this is when you get the full blast of your little one\'s excretions (quite possibly 3-5 days worth of them), so hold your breath!Although there is room for improvement on this design, I haven\'t seen or heard of any other model that can do this job nearly as well for as reasonable a price.",4,"i chose the diaper champ over the diaper geni becaus of it money-sav featur of be abl to accomod most plastic bag with handles.

There\'s a little plastic tab that\'s suppused to slide in as your opening the top, but instead it get\'s cought so it allows the top to open up only partially. It may just be one defective item that somehow passed the quality control inspection, but I\'ve given up on diaper pails in general.

Not only did it do a comparable job at keeping odors inside, it was extremely easy to use and did not require me to spend an additional [$$$] each month on refills.

Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often. They\'re bigger than diaper genies, yes, but not quite big enough for a baby with a big appetite.This smearing problem, is, in my opinion, probably the source of the smell that others complain of. We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum. What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch. You\'d need to open the latch before starting the change, and close it after, but that seems easier to me than thumping and wiggling a diaper champ in the middle of the change. It will control odors better, and you won\'t have to be continually wiping poop off the outside of it.",2,"we want to have a conveni lock recept for poop-laden diaper in our toddler\' bedroom. while they do lock, they aren\'t convenient. wipe get caught in the mechan and you have to shake and bang it while tri to keep wriggl babi on the chang table. poop get into the chamber, and smear on the outsid of the rotat drum, particularli when they get too full, which they do often. they\'r bigger than diaper genies, yes, but not quit big enough for a babi with a big appetite.thi smear problem, is, in my opinion, probabl the sourc of the smell that other complain of. we have cure the smell by keep handi a contain of bleach-wipes, and frequent wipe thoroughli in and out of the drum. what a hassle!our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler get curiou attach an applianc latch. you\'d need to open the latch befor start the change, and close it after, but that seem easier to me than thump and wiggl a diaper champ in the middl of the change. it will control odor better, and you won\'t have to be continu wipe poop off the outsid of it."

When I first saw the Diaper Champ and read what you needed for it and what it did, there was no question that I wanted it!  It\'s awesome!  When they say it\'s odorless, it REALLY is.  The only time you ever smell anything is when you open the lid to empty it and all the dirty diapers are right there.  You never smell anything when it\'s closed.

Never do we detect a diaper odor (and my husband has a very sensitive sense of smell and is usually very quick to complain about such things).  For those who say they have a problem with the Diaper Champ getting stuck...the ONLY time this ever happens to us is when the bag is full and needs to be changed.  We love that it uses regular kitchen trash bags, makes it much more economical.  We have not found that we need to worry about frequent emptying or cleaning.  We just leave the Champ to do its job until the mechanism begins to feel like it\'s getting stuck...then we change the bag.  For us this means about once a week.  Not only is the Champ EASY to use, it\'s kind of fun.  Before our daughter was born we really worried about whether the diaper pail we chose would be effective enough for us because my husband is so sensitive to smells.  But she\'s two months old now and we still just can\'t say enough good things about it.UPDATE:  My daughter is now 9 months old and we STILL love our Diaper Champ.  She\'s eating solid foods, diapers are smellier, but the Champ is still doing it\'s job.  We empty once a week and spray with Lysol.  Yes, there is an odor when changing the bag, but we take the bag directly out to the trash, spray Champ with Lysol, insert new bag and close the thing back up.  Everything is just fine after that.

396,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Like other reviewers, I put this diaper pail on my registry because I just didn\'t want the hassle of having to buy special bags--what happens when you run out in the middle of the night!  I liked the fact that you can use regular bags in this diaper pail... in fact I frequently recycle BabiesRUs bags by using them in the Diaper CHamp.  I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I\'ve never had a problem with smell (I\'ve been using it for two+ months now).  You just put the diaper in the hole... flip the lid and the counterweight pushes the diaper down into the bag underneath and its ready for the next diaper--then you flip it back.  The flip handle does get stuck sometimes... but only when it\'s TIME TO EMPTY THE PAIL!!!!  Some reviewers seem to think the pail should empty itself, but unfortunately nothing on the market will do that for you.  When you change the bag (which is incredibly easy to do) you can just spray the inside with a little lysol and then periodically wipe it out with a sponge and some bleach.  I\'d do that much even with the more expensive diaper pails and I\'d still have to buy expensive special bags.... You can\'t expect something that contains poop to smell like a rose or to be germ free without a little work on your part, but with the Diaper Champ you can have a smell-free nursery AND save money by using plain ordinary garbage bags (or recycled plastic bags!)",5,"like other reviewers, i put thi diaper pail on my registri becaus i just didn\'t want the hassl of have to buy special bags--what happen when you run out in the middl of the night! i like the fact that you can use regular bag in thi diaper pail... in fact i frequent recycl babiesru bag by use them in the diaper champ. i have twins--so you can imagin how much poop goe into thi pail and i\'v never had a problem with smell (i\'v been use it for two+ month now). you just put the diaper in the hole... flip the lid and the counterweight push the diaper down into the bag underneath and it readi for the next diaper--then you flip it back. the flip handl doe get stuck sometimes... but onli when it\' time to empti the pail!!!! some review seem to think the pail should empti itself, but unfortun noth on the market will do that for you. when you chang the bag (which is incred easi to do) you can just spray the insid with a littl lysol and then period wipe it out with a spong and some bleach. i\'d do that much even with the more expens diaper pail and i\'d still have to buy expens special bags.... you can\'t expect someth that contain poop to smell like a rose or to be germ free without a littl work on your part, but with the diaper champ you can have a smell-fre nurseri and save money by use plain ordinari garbag bag (or recycl plastic bags!)"

398,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"When our daughter was born we bought the diaper genie and it soon became another unused thing in our closet.  I found it so impractical, because no matter what it says it is never truely one hand operable.  And it takes so long to stuff and twist that the baby is neglected on the changing table for a longer period of time.  Also, it didn\'t hold very many diapers and was a pain to unload.  I would rather just walk each diaper outside!  So when we were pregnant with our son I told my husband that we had to go shopping for a new diaper pail and that\'s when we found the diaper champ.  I now give this at every baby shower I go to even if the mom-to-be has registered for the diaper genie!  I know she will convert to this one.  I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.  All you do is flip the handle over and you\'re done.  No need to push the diaper in with your hand (gross!) just let gravity do it\'s thing.  It is also very easy to unload and install a new bag.  Plus there are no special bags!

I\'ve found that when it starts getting alittle full just shake it to level the diapers out and you will be able to get more in there.

429,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have to say I really like the Diaper Champ, with one exception-it is definitely NOT always odor free.  I have had to put it in the bathroom now instead of the baby room, because smells from &quot;stinky&quot; diapers will seep out.  I think the best advice is to wrap the really smelly ones in a plastic bag before putting them in. Another word of advice-keep a can of Lysol next to it to spray when you throw a diaper away. It can also be hard to open-I\'ve broken several nails on it.  I\'ve only had it a few weeks (I\'ve been using it for my toddler\'s diapers until my new baby comes), and I\'m hoping that the latch on it loosens up a bit with opening and shutting.

Here\'s a short list of the main reasons I\'d recommend this against diaper genie:5. Diaper Champ doesn\'t use expensive refills like the genie. We were going through 2-3 of those $5 refills a month with the genie. On the conservative side, say that was $120 a year in genie refills. With the Diaper Champ, I bought one big box of Glad Kitchen drawstring bags (150 bags) for $15 at the warehouse club. We change the bag 1-2x weekly. The 150 bags will probably last 1 1/2 -2 years, for $15. (The Champ box says you can use plastic grocery bags. Don\'t. They\'re way too small and don\'t hold enough diapers to make it worth the while.)4. The Champ holds a lot more than the genie. Less frequent emptying.3. The genie was a pain to empty and even more work to change refills. Emptying involves tying off the tiny little sausage tube bag, restarting the cut end of the refill. Pain. Changing the refill was just annoying. When the refill runs out, there\'s not enough bag to tie so you are stuck holding an open end of a dirty diaper bag. I don\'t need that. And at any change or refill, you have to find another bag to drop the sausage string of dirty diapers into. With the champ, I open the lid, tie off the drawstring bag and that bag goes straight into the garbage can. The new bag goes in as simple as a trash-can liner and close the lid.2. The genie broke after about 15 months. There are 4 little plastic prongs inside that hold the diaper in place while you twist the ring to seal the diaper in the bag. The spring on one broke and it never held the diapers well again after that.1. And my top reason why the diaper champ is champ: It\'s perfectly easy to use, impossible to use wrong. Whenever we had a babysitter or family member helping while we used the genie, we always took a couple of minutes to show them how to use it. We\'d come home and every time, they\'d gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in. No, it\'s not difficult to use or get right once you do it a few times but if you only use it once a month, that dial on top that turns the cutter is just to obvious to turn to ignore and impossible not to turn. Every single time someone got it wrong. So, the Diaper Champ. you drop the diaper in the open hole and flip the handle and it\'s gone. I can\'t think of a way anyone could do it wrong and most people who\'ve used it so far, don\'t need even the simplest hint from us on how to use it.",5,"we put a diaper geni on the shower list for the first baby. we use it for 2 year and it wa ok but we were fed up with it and i took a chanc on the diaper champ for #2. after 5 months, we couldn\'t be happier with diaper champ. here\' a short list of the main reason i\'d recommend thi against diaper genie:5. diaper champ doesn\'t use expens refil like the genie. we were go through 2-3 of those $5 refil a month with the genie. on the conserv side, say that wa $120 a year in geni refills. with the diaper champ, i bought one big box of glad kitchen drawstr bag (150 bags) for $15 at the warehous club. we chang the bag 1-2x weekly. the 150 bag will probabl last 1 1/2 -2 years, for $15.

We were going to get a Diaper Genie like so many folks do, but the associate showed us the Diaper Champ and how easy it was to use. All I have to do is turn the handle and the diaper goes down.  There\'s no twisting and no special liners to buy.  As far as smell goes, ALL diaper pails will smell if they\'re not changed often enough.  We don\'t have a problem with ours smelling as long as we change it every three to four days (which should be done no matter what product you buy).  When I got pregnant with my second child (they are only 18months apart) we bought a second Diaper Champ.  We also just purchased one for my brother-in-law and his wife for their new baby.

I\'ve even had other Moms tell me that they can\'t smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.

We\'ve been using the Diaper Champ for almost a year now since our baby was born.

Pros: easy to use one-hand drop-in mechanism, good odor trapping, can use just about any kind of grocery or plastic bag, convenient handle, and easy to clean. Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing. Hint: If using spray cleaning, don\'t spray water into the drop-in hole.

512,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.  In just a few months use, the Diaper Champ pays for itself by saving money on costly refills needed for other brands.  I have never had an odor problem, but I have a 5-month-old breastfed baby, so I know her diapers now are not as stinky as they will get once we go to solids.  I also use the Glad ""Odor-Control"" bags (the price of 100 bags is probably about the same as a DG RF and will last over a year).  The Diaper Champ is also very easy to use and easy to change bags.

513,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have never written a review for Amazon but I saw some of the poor reviews on the Diaper Champ and had to add my two cents . . .When my sister got pregnant she could not decide if she should register for the Diaper Champ or the Diaper Genie.  She left it up to me and after reviewing both items I went with the Diaper Champ . . .  The idea of having to continually purchase bags for the Diaper Genie seemed like a waste when the Diaper Champ lets you use any type of bag . . .  My nephew is now over two years old and while he has begun potty training, my sister still uses the Diaper Champ I gave her . . .When it came time for me to choose a diaper disposal system, I put the Diaper Champ on my registry.  Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?  True, the mechanism sometimes won\'t ""swing"" the dirty diaper into the pail but HELLO that is a sign that it is probably time to put in a new bag.  Yes, it can eventually start to smell if you don\'t change it regularly . . . but then again if you used a metal safe lined with carbon to hold your kids diapers eventually baby poop and pee smell would emanate from it if you didn\'t clean it out regularly . . . Realistically the thing holds dirty stinky diapers and yep it is going to smell when you open it but hey . . . my kids tush smells when I wipe it but I still love him :)My personal tip . . . if you belong to a wholesale club like BJ\'s, Costco or Sam\'s check to see if they have the Glad Kitchen Bags.  The BJ\'s we shop in has a box of 200 for $9.99.  As long as you do not attempt to overstuff them (i.e., get lazy and don\'t change the bag regularly) they work perfectly.  I also use them in the small garbage pails in our apartment.  I could wait for a sale and use a coupon (the way I shop for most things) but it takes months to go through the box and I like knowing they are always on hand . . . At about $.05 a bag, the super duper box of bags makes my life easy and that as any parent knows is ***PRICELESS***.",5,"i have never written a review for amazon but i saw some of the poor review on the diaper champ and had to add my two cent . . .when my sister got pregnant she could not decid if she should regist for the diaper champ or the diaper genie. she left it up to me and after review both item i went with the diaper champ . . . the idea of have to continu purchas bag for the diaper geni seem like a wast when the diaper champ let you use ani type of bag . . . my nephew is now over two year old and while he ha begun potti training, my sister still use the diaper champ i gave her . . .when it came time for me to choos a diaper dispos system, i put the diaper champ on my registry. yes, it can be a bit tricki to open (i found use two hand work best) but then again do i want someth that is hold wet and otherwis dirti diaper to open easily? true, the mechan sometim won\'t ""swing"" the dirti diaper into the pail but hello that is a sign that it is probabl time to put in a new bag. yes, it can eventu start to smell if you don\'t chang it regularli . . . but then again if you use a metal safe line with carbon to hold your kid diaper eventu babi poop and pee smell would eman from it if you didn\'t clean it out regularli . . . realist the thing hold dirti stinki diaper and yep it is go to smell when you open it but hey . . . my kid tush smell when i wipe it but i still love him :)mi person tip . . . if you belong to a wholesal club like bj\'s, costco or sam\' check to see if they have the glad kitchen bags. the bj\' we shop in ha a box of 200 for $9.99. as long as you do not attempt to overstuff them (i.e., get lazi and don\'t chang the bag regularly) they work perfectly. i also use them in the small garbag pail in our apartment. i could wait for a sale and use a coupon (the way i shop for most things) but it take month to go through the box and i like know they are alway on hand . . . at about $.05 a bag, the super duper box of bag make my life easi and that as ani parent know is ***priceless***."

562,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I researched all the available options and decided to try the Diaper Champ instad of diaper genie. It made diaper disposal a snap!! The one handed disposal was soo convenient when i was holding a squirmy baby with one arm. It is smell free if you empty frequently and almost so if you don\'t. This thing lived next to my sidetable for the first few months and often it was only emptied when it was full (its pretty large). I used some simple tricks to prevent smell leakage:-Rolled and taped up the diapers securely before disposing-Always returned the handle to original position so that only one side of the opening stayed in contact with smelly diapers (you\'ll know what i mean when you use it)-Used scented odor lock GLAD bags and aired out the champ between bag changesThe only cons I found were that opening it is a bit tough ( you get more adept at it though and its safer) and there is a small opening below the handle which is where the odor tends to escape when it does.The cons are pretty minor given how well this thing works AND it is cost effective...i hate the idea of being forced to buy brand specific refills. It may seem bulky and not great to look at but I have to admit i have at times emptied the champ only when it could not take a single more diaper.

571,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We did alot of research on diaper pails before our first child was born.  We knew a few couples with the Diaper Genie, and one couple with the Diaper Champ.  The couple with the Diaper Champ has a baby that is 3 months older than our child.  This couple liked their Champ just fine, saying they noticed no odors.  We also read tons of reviews, mainly here on Amazon, of both products.  And from the reviews, it seemed there were many happy customers of both products.  So we decided, if they were about equal, we would go with the more convenient and cheaper solution, the Champ.Well, we were pretty happy for about 4 to 6 months.  We very much liked that we could use our regular trash bags.  And changing the Champ\'s bag is very easy.  But after our child was well into eating solids, at about 7 months, the smell became unbearable.  It really is true that babies\' poops really start to stink much, much worse when they eat lots of solids.  So we went out and bought a Diaper Genie, and are now very happy with the Genie.  The Genie has 2 big advantages over the Champ, in regards to smell control.  1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie\'s twisting mechanism.  2)  The filler bags progress in thickness, so as your child gets older, and her poops get smellier, you can get thicker, better bags.After using the Genie for about a month now, we are very pleased.  The Champ is essentially a simple waste pail with a fancy hood.  The hood and ordinary trash bags don\'t do much for odor prevention.  The drawbacks to the Genie though, are that you must buy their fillers, and the bag changing mechanism is much more complicated than the Champ\'s.  We thought these were worth dealing with to prevent the odors.",2,"we did alot of research on diaper pail befor our first child wa born. we knew a few coupl with the diaper genie, and one coupl with the diaper champ. the coupl with the diaper champ ha a babi that is 3 month older than our child. thi coupl like their champ just fine, say they notic no odors. we also read ton of reviews, mainli here on amazon, of both products. and from the reviews, it seem there were mani happi custom of both products. so we decided, if they were about equal, we would go with the more conveni and cheaper solution, the champ.well, we were pretti happi for about 4 to 6 months. we veri much like that we could use our regular trash bags. and chang the champ\' bag is veri easy. but after our child wa well into eat solids, at about 7 months, the smell becam unbearable. it realli is true that babies\' poop realli start to stink much, much wors when they eat lot of solids. so we went out and bought a diaper genie, and are now veri happi with the genie. the geni ha 2 big advantag over the champ, in regard to smell control. 1) each diaper is contain in it own litt pouch via the genie\' twist mechanism. 2) the filler bag progress in thickness, so as your child get older, and her poop get smellier, you can get thicker, better bags.aft use the geni for about a month now, we are veri pleased. the champ is essenti a simpl wast pail with a fanci hood. the hood and ordinari trash bag don\'t do much for odor prevention. the drawback to the geni though, are that you must buy their fillers, and the bag chang mechan is much more complic than the champ\'s. we thought these were worth deal with to prevent the odors."
572,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We registered for the diaper champ after comparing it with the diaper genie and diaper dekor at the store.  We had used the diaper genie while working in the church nursery and found it to be extremely difficult to use with the number of diapers we were changing there.  Now our own baby is four months old, and we have loved having the diaper champ at home.  It is so easy to use and does not stink, or at least it hasn\'t yet.  We use Ruffies scented garbage bags and change the bag when full, about every five days.  I would definitely recommend the diaper champ.",5,"we regist for the diaper champ after compar it with the diaper geni and diaper dekor at the store. we had use the diaper geni while work in the church nurseri and found it to be extrem difficult to use with the number of diaper we were chang there. now our own babi is four month old, and we have love have the diaper champ at home. it is so easi to use and doe not stink, or at least it hasn\'t yet. we use ruffi scent garbag bag and chang the bag when full, about everi five days. i would definit recommend the diaper champ."

575,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The champ is great because you don\'t have to waste anymore money buying expensive refills like the diaper genie.  This one uses regular bags (I use 32 gallon bags).  I did have some problems with the odor, but I think anything you put poop in and let sit for days will have odor so that\'s inevitable!  Here\'s some tricks for this Champ:1.  Put an Arm & Hammer Baking Soda box at the bottom of the pail to help eliminate orders.  And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don\'t expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.  The side straps of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper really tight and use the straps to hold it together, otherwise your diaper shoot will get clogged.3.  If you\'re like me, you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.  Keep a few handy in the nursery and use them to bag the poopy diapers.  Double bagging them helps to eliminate the orders.Hope this helps!",5,"the champ is great becaus you don\'t have to wast anymor money buy expens refil like the diaper genie. thi one use regular bag (i use 32 gallon bags). i did have some problem with the odor, but i think anyth you put poop in and let sit for day will have odor so that\' inevitable! here\' some trick for thi champ:1. put an arm & hammer bake soda box at the bottom of the pail to help elimin orders. and the obvious, chang the bag everi coupl day to elimin the smell... don\'t expect to leav it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2. the side strap of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper realli tight and use the strap to hold it together, otherwis your diaper shoot will get clogged.3. if you\'r like me, you probabl have ton of groceri bag lay around. keep a few handi in the nurseri and use them to bag the poopi diapers. doubl bag them help to elimin the orders.hop thi helps!"

578,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have to agree with the other moms. At first the Diaper Champ was a champ, until I had to change the bag.  It is difficult to open, not to mention everytime I did change the bag my nails would break (and I don\'t have long ones).  My daughter is 19 months, still breast feeding and eating solids and let me tell you, her pooh stinks.  Once I decided to take the Diaper Champ out of the room and walk each diaper to the outside dumpster, it still took weeks for the smell to get out of the room.  It penetrated into the room.  Not to mention, one day, little tiny flies started growing inside.  I was changing the bag on an every day basis.  This is by far the worst product out there.

581,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I am one of those super-critical shoppers who researches everything about a product and then second-guesses purchase decisions...but I love this diaper pail.  I was completely satisfied with my purchase and even bought a second one for our upstairs bedroom.*It really is cost effective.  You don\'t have to spend money on refill bags.  I just use the pastic ones from the grocery store.  They work perfectly.*It is so easy to use, so easy to change.  I tried another brand of diaper pail and you had to push a button and flip a lid and push the diaper through...no.  You should spend zero time disposing of diapers and all your time with your new baby.  The Diaper Champ is effortless.*It effectively keeps the room from smelling like dirty diapers.  I live where it is hot and humid and don\'t have central air so smell containment is important.  It\'s not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.  Scented bags makes the whole room smell kind of nice if you have a super-sensitive nose.*At first I was turned off by the look of the diaper pail, but I have come to appreciate its design.  I bought and tried out a different one and found that the Diaper Champ is taller (about 27"" high) and narrower.  This means that it takes up less floor space but still holds quite a few diapers (I empty it every 2-3 days).  Also I don\'t have to bend down as much to use it, which really makes a difference when you use it 20 times a day.*A small but considerate detail--there is a foot around the bottom of the pail that you can hold down while you change the bag.  This along with the way the weight is centered in the design makes it so the whole thing doesn\'t fall over when you open it to change the bag.  The other brand I had tried kept falling over when I tried to change the bag and it was incredibly frustrating.*The only thing against the product I would mention is the noise.  It makes a ""thunk"" when you dispose a diaper into the pail.  I don\'t mind it during the day--it\'s actually kind of fun to use.  But during night-time changings you have to flip the handle a little slower so it doesn\'t make a noise.Anyways, I hope this helps.",5,"i am one of those super-crit shopper who research everyth about a product and then second-guess purchas decisions...but i love thi diaper pail. i wa complet satisfi with my purchas and even bought a second one for our upstair bedroom.*it realli is cost effective. you don\'t have to spend money on refil bags. i just use the pastic one from the groceri store. they work perfectly.*it is so easi to use, so easi to change. i tri anoth brand of diaper pail and you had to push a button and flip a lid and push the diaper through...no. you should spend zero time dispos of diaper and all your time with your new baby. the diaper champ is effortless.*it effect keep the room from smell like dirti diapers. i live where it is hot and humid and don\'t have central air so smell contain is important. it\' not perfect but if you regularli empti the pail it work well. scent bag make the whole room smell kind of nice if you have a super-sensit nose.*at first i wa turn off by the look of the diaper pail, but i have come to appreci it design. i bought and tri out a differ one and found that the diaper champ is taller (about 27"" high) and narrower. thi mean that it take up less floor space but still hold quit a few diaper (i empti it everi 2-3 days). also i don\'t have to bend down as much to use it, which realli make a differ when you use it 20 time a day.*a small but consider detail--ther is a foot around the bottom of the pail that you can hold down while you chang the bag. thi along with the way the weight is center in the design make it so the whole thing doesn\'t fall over when you open it to chang the bag. the other brand i had tri kept fall over when i tri to chang the bag and it wa incred frustrating.*th onli thing against the product i would mention is the noise. it make a ""thunk"" when you dispos a diaper into the pail. i don\'t mind it dure the day--it\' actual kind of fun to use. but dure night-tim chang you have to flip the handl a littl slower so it doesn\'t make a noise.anyways, i hope thi helps."

I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.  After they start to pile up in there, you do start to get an odor.  Do not buy this if you are looking to avoid diaper smell--you will probably be disappointed, especially since this product costs about $30.  What I\'m currently doing is what other reviewers have said--I just put the dirty diapers in with the kitchen garbage since that gets taken out frequently.  (No, my kitchen garbage is not actually in the kitchen, it\'s on the other side of a safety gate in the adjoining laundry room.  Those of you with toddlers understand I\'m sure.)You know what IS nice about this diaper pail though?  It keeps your kid out of the dirty diapers. When my daughter started getting into everything, at least I didn\'t have to worry about her getting into the nasty diapers and doing anything with them.I don\'t think this product is worth $30.  It\'s essentially a plastic garbage can with a nifty lid.  It should probably cost half what it does.  If you get this, try using the plastic grocery store bags and taking them out more often.I want to add one last thing for those parents that don\'t know--a lot of parents aren\'t emptying poo from diapers into the toilet before throwing away the disposable diaper.  This is something you are supposed to do, not just for cloth diapers.  That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade. I realize this takes some of the convenience out of it being a disposable diaper, but it is something we all need to be doing.  It\'ll also help cut down on the diaper stink of course.",3,"my daughter is about to turn 2 and i am start to potti train her, so it is time to sell my diaper champ at our next yard sale. i am read the mix review on thi product and want to give my two cents...no, thi product doe not total lock in the smell of dirti diapers. after they start to pile up in there, you do start to get an odor. do not buy thi if you are look to avoid diaper smell--you will probabl be disappointed, especi sinc thi product cost about $30. what i\'m current do is what other review have said--i just put the dirti diaper in with the kitchen garbag sinc that get taken out frequently.

596,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the Diaper Champ and I plan to get another one!  I have one in the baby\'s room and I\'d like another one for downstairs next to her pack \'n play (since it has a changing table on it).  I feel like it keeps odors in as long as you do what other people suggested such as every time you take out a bag, spray and air out for a couple minutes and then replace with a new bag.  Also, I always make sure that I roll up each diaper securely before putting it in the diaper champ.  We only have to empty ours about every 2 weeks right now (our baby is 11 weeks old) because I change her downstairs half of the time.I really like the fact that you can use your own trash bags.  What a cost saver.  No special bags, no twisting (like the diaper genie), no tying special knots in the bags, no buying refills... as you can see I don\'t like the genie one bit.  As a babysitter for someone who had the genie - I could never figure the darn thing out.  Think of someone who comes to watch your baby - the diaper champ is so easy and they\'ll almost never have to change the bag for you.  That diaper genie was always full when I was babysitting.  Ugh!The only reason I gave this four instead of five stars, was because you can easily break your nails trying to open it up to replace the bag (the first time I did, despite the warnings!).

597,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the convenience of not having to worry about special bags, that\'s why I rated this so high. However, when I first started using this diaper pail, the velcro from my daughter\'s diapers was getting stuck on something inside the lid.  Needless to say, getting the diapers unstuck was disgusting.  Once I yanked out the fabric that the diapers were getting stuck on, I really liked the diaper pail.  The dirty diapers still stink, so I put each dirty diaper in its own sack and throw them out in the kitchen garbage so that they go out every night.  Now my house never stinks like a dirty diaper.",4,"i love the conveni of not have to worri about special bags, that\' whi i rate thi so high. however, when i first start use thi diaper pail, the velcro from my daughter\' diaper wa get stuck on someth insid the lid. needless to say, get the diaper unstuck wa disgusting. onc i yank out the fabric that the diaper were get stuck on, i realli like the diaper pail. the dirti diaper still stink, so i put each dirti diaper in it own sack and throw them out in the kitchen garbag so that they go out everi night. now my hous never stink like a dirti diaper."

By trash day the pail is full, easily indicated by having to push the plunger down manually because the other dirty diapers are close to the top.  The plunger can make a loud \'thud\' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.  It doesn\'t seem to bother the baby, but I don\'t want to take any chances!  The other pail we use is very inferior.  It takes 2 hands to operate, is very short and doesn\'t contain the smell well.

614,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We like this diaper pail.  I\'ve had two others with our older kids--one a diaper genie (which I personally found to be a pain) and another by fisher price that I don\'t know if they still  make.We used this for all diapers for the first six months, until our baby started having solid food.  As an exclusively breast fed baby, there were no odors escaping at all.  (Formula fed babies have stinkier diapers, so I don\'t personally know if it would be as efficient for them.)  My older two actually enjoyed putting the diaper in.  It\'s easy to change out.  I always opened it up outside (if you try to open it inside there will be some odors escape), pulled out the full bag, sprayed the can with lysol, and kept a dryer sheet in the bottom which I changed every month or so.Now that little one is having solids, I personally don\'t expect any diaper pail to contain the smell, so I put dirty ones directly outside.  We still use it for the wet ones.  It has worked out fine because at this point he only has one messy diaper a day.I had a little trouble with the adhesive on the gasket thingee coming loose, but I emailed them and they very promptly sent me a new one for free, along with a few extras in case it happened again (which it hasn\'t), so I think the customer service is good.The only thing I don\'t like about it is that you have to empty it fairly often, but I also recognize that honestly that\'s ridiculous on my part.  The more it holds, the more room it takes up, the heavier it gets, etc.  And the fact that you can\'t go more than two or three days (as a newborn, anyway) is probably one of the reasons it contains the smell.  The longer they sit, the more rank they get.  Now that he\'s older and doesn\'t go through 15 diapers a day, I only change it about once a week.",4,"we like thi diaper pail. i\'v had two other with our older kids--on a diaper geni (which i person found to be a pain) and anoth by fisher price that i don\'t know if they still make.w use thi for all diaper for the first six months, until our babi start have solid food. as an exclus breast fed baby, there were no odor escap at all.

616,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ was recommended to us in the Babies R Us asile by a nanny who was picking up one for one of the households that she was working with.  She loved her previous experience with the product, and we are glad that she spoke up to recommend it to us.Pluses: It is a LOT easier to use than the Diaper Genie (for example you can throw a diaper away with just one hand!  Woo-hoo!)  Also, you can use regular kitchen trash bags inside it, so you don\'t have to buy special bags at an inflated price.  Further, due to it\'s extra large containment area you don\'t have to take out the trash as often as you would have to with the smaller Diaper Genie and the smell seems to stay inside just fine. :)The one minus that I experienced: According to the directions that came in the box, you can take apart the drum/piston assembly if you should wish to thoroughly clean the inside of it.  When we first bought the Diaper Genie I tried to take it apart.  I *could not* get it to come apart, nor could my husband.  It would not BUDGE-so much so that if the directions didn\'t specifically mention that it could be separated I would have assumed that it was not built to come apart.  After trying to get it apart for a ridiculous amount of time, (using practically everything from my nails to a crowbar,) I finally broke down and called the customer service number to see if I was missing some key- a button or lever to push- anything!  The customer service person told me to ""try harder"", then call again if I couldn\'t get it open!(Insert long pause with upraised eyebrows here.)Needless to say, I thought that was a bit less than helpful.  So... maybe my Diaper Genie was warped, or maybe they are all impossible to get open- it\'s your gamble.  I didn\'t take it back to the store because I assume that they are all that way.

625,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We are using the Diaper Champ with our first baby and we love it!!  We don\'t have a problem with odors because we keep a roll of diaper disposer bags (little roll of blue plastic bags with a yellow duck dispenser) nearby in the changing table to put the smelly diapers in - this keeps everything clean and the blue bags are extremely economical to purchase (maybe $3 for 50 bags).  A small price to pay for an almost odorless diaper pail - we only use them for poopy diapers, not for wet-only diapers so they last for quite a while.  The bag in the Diaper Champ still gets changed 1 - 2 times per week because it\'s full, not because it\'s smelly.  This method also keeps the chamber and plunger free of messes.  Since the Diaper Champ can be used with any garbage bag, it\'s one less thing to have to remember when shopping and changing the bag is so simple and quick, it\'s easier than changing our kitchen garbage bag.

643,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I\'ve read all of the reviews of those of you who can\'t understand why the rest of us hated our Diaper Champs, and I just have to say-give it a while, you\'ll find out. We bought our Diaper Champ when our first son was born. For pretty much  the first year we LOVED it. Everyone is right, you don\'t have to spend money on seperate bags, it\'s a nice height so you don\'t have to bend over it and it\'s really easy to use. I think it takes about a year though, or maybe even a little longer, and it will start to reek so bad that you\'ll want to sleep at the neighbors house just to escape the smell. For all of you who haven\'t used yours long enough-just wait, it will happen. We scrubbed ours with bleach, we emptied it daily, we aired it out in the backyard for two days, and then we finally started putting every single diaper in ziplock bags before putting them in the diaper champ (so much for no extra bags!). NOTHING helped. I\'m not stupid, I understand that when it comes to diapers, nothing is smell proof. We emptied it all the time and disinfected it constantly. But I\'m not talking normal stinky diaper smell. I\'m talking the combined smell of every stinky diaper in the entire world. It was SO BAD. Unless you plan on potty training your child when he turns one, and good luck with that, you\'ll probably end up replacing yours before the diaper days are over. In the end we bought a Diaper Genie.

644,Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I see that there are complaints of stinkiness regarding this unit, but short of hermetic sealing, you\'re gonna be dealing with poo smell. I think a bit of odor is a fair trade-off for the ability to use normal trash bags and not be locked into yet another system of expendables. (See Braun shaver cleaning cartridges, etc.) The unit relies on a fairly tight seal between the bag (where it passes through the dark blue plastic holder) and the ""funnel"" bottom on the underside of the top portion. If the bag installation is somewhat off this would probably lead to a poor to non-existent seal.That said, the design of the unit is pretty clever - the piston and gravity work to deposit the diaper into the bag in one fell swoop as the handle is rotated through a 180-degree arc, without any hazardous poking of fingers in the vicinity of fresh poo.  That the lid latch is not immediately easy to pop open can be seen as a feature - keeping the contents safe from rude dogs who knock over trash for the goodies inside.  All told it seems to work very well.",5,"i see that there are complaint of stinki regard thi unit, but short of hermet sealing, you\'r gonna be deal with poo smell. i think a bit of odor is a fair trade-off for the abil to use normal trash bag and not be lock into yet anoth system of expendables.

993,Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I love this tub.  I think it was a great idea.  This works as a wonderful transition from a baby tub to the adult tub.  I bought it when my son was starting to sit, I didn\'t have to worry about a bath seats suctions not working and my son tipping over. Also I know it is hard to get older babies in and out of a regular bath seat without scraping knees. This bath seats clips on so I put him in the bathtub first, then just clip the seat on around him.  He can sit in the tub and play with his toys keeping everything within arms reach of him.

1021,Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"For a first time mom, this was great,  for a newborn baby I would recommend using the slope in a sink that is  a better level for your back.  But for a few month old baby the slope in the bath is great, she was able to lie there and kick and splash and enjoy herself.The only set back that this has is that because it can be stored (one side fits into the other side) smaller it has two separate levels,  the thing with this is that the slope goes over the deeper part and you have to fill the tub up with more water to get to the higher end.  Which means that you have to use that much more water inorder to get a good depth.

I then bought the tubside bath seat, but didn\'t like that either.  The seat sits well over an inch above the bottom of the tub, so you need to use quite a bit of water to get it up to her legs.

1051,Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I owned this tub with my first child and had to discard it when she grew out of it because it cracked. For my second child, I bought the First Years tub, which ended up being a total pain -- I threw it away and purchased this tub again.PROS -- I really like the sling for newborns. It can be used in this tub, as well as in your sink or large bathtub.  It\'s also easy to clean.-- The tummy rest is great once your child can sit up fairly well.  My babies both leaned their arms over the bar that goes across the middle and could enjoy splashing and playing with toys while I bathed them.  Having a good support like this makes it so much easier to keep a hold of them with one hand while grabbing shampoo, wash cloth, etc. with the other.-- It\'s great that the support can be removed for cleaning and for a last step tub before your child uses the big tub.CONS-- As other reviewers have said, it\'s a total pain to lock the center into place to keep it from leaking.  Once you\'ve done it the first time, it\'s OK, but I was fooled and thought it had snapped (it was the side locks making that noise!) and it leaked all over my counter.  I don\'t understand why it\'s not just manufactured at the full size without this expansion thing -- it\'s not like it\'s that much smaller when it\'s not locked into place.-- The suction cups are very strong, and it can be difficult to empty the tub when it\'s on your counter.  You have to sort of pop up the back ones and then one of the front ones and scoot it over your sink.  It\'s a little tricky, but you get used to it.-- Because the suction cups are so strong, our first tub eventually got a hole in the bottom where cup pulled the entire plastic around it from the base of the tub (hence the need to throw it away after the first child).I have only one comparison, which is the one-star First Years tub, and I\'d take this one over it any day.",4,"i own thi tub with my first child and had to discard it when she grew out of it becaus it cracked. for my second child, i bought the first year tub, which end up be a total pain -- i threw it away and purchas thi tub again.pro -- i realli like the sling for newborns. it can be use in thi tub, as well as in your sink or larg bathtub. it\' also easi to clean.-- the tummi rest is great onc your child can sit up fairli well. my babi both lean their arm over the bar that goe across the middl and could enjoy splash and play with toy while i bath them. have a good support like thi make it so much easier to keep a hold of them with one hand while grab shampoo, wash cloth, etc. with the other.-- it\' great that the support can be remov for clean and for a last step tub befor your child use the big tub.cons-- as other review have said, it\' a total pain to lock the center into place to keep it from leaking. onc you\'v done it the first time, it\' ok, but i wa fool and thought it had snap (it wa the side lock make that noise!) and it leak all over my counter. i don\'t understand whi it\' not just manufactur at the full size without thi expans thing -- it\' not like it\' that much smaller when it\' not lock into place.-- the suction cup are veri strong, and it can be difficult to empti the tub when it\' on your counter. you have to sort of pop up the back one and then one of the front one and scoot it over your sink. it\' a littl tricky, but you get use to it.-- becaus the suction cup are so strong, our first tub eventu got a hole in the bottom where cup pull the entir plastic around it from the base of the tub (henc the need to throw it away after the first child).i have onli one comparison, which is the one-star first year tub, and i\'d take thi one over it ani day."

1056,Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I went through 3 bathtubs before finding this wonderful tub. It features 4 bathing options,4 suction tabs, and a drain plug. Most infant baths I came accross are chair shaped. I found that my daughter could not get fully immersed in the water and splash in these chair-shaped baths. The 4-in-1 Bath Station By Safety 1st is shaped like an ordinary basin and has 2 options for how the baby sits in it. It is deep enough for my daughter to experience floating and kicking sensations which she absolutely loves. As a tiny infant, I would lay her on the soft slope and hold her so that her body was mostly covered. She would kick her legs and let them float. Of course, you cannot take you hands off the baby while she is lying like this, but that\'s not a bad thing in that it keeps you right there and vigilant!Now that she is nearly 7 months old she sits up in the ring at the one end. The ring goes accross her middle and between her legs. This was absolutely magical for her. I cannot emphasize how much she loved it; leaning forward and reaching for her plastic bath toys and kicking her legs and arms up and down. She also learnt to hold onto the rail in front of her for balance. While you should never leave the room when bathing a baby; with the rail in this bath, you can take your hands off the baby and watch happily as she plays for as long as you will let her. She cannot fall backward or forward, and nor can she get her head under water.The bath also folds up. The two halves slide together so that it is half the size. I don\'t often do this though I can see that it would be useful! However because of the join in the middle of the bath, the two sides are different depths. This is no problem - only, I wish the deeper side were the side where the older baby sits in the ring, and the shallower side were the side you would put the slope for newborns. Not a big deal, just a suggestion!There is one downside is that once the bath is full, you cannot move it. If you do try to slide it forward or backward, all the water leaks out of it! So once it is filled, best to leave it where it is!I highly recommend this product which you can use for many many months right from birth.

1147,Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"Superyard XT is an excellent product for child containment, providing exactly the protection a parent desires for outdoor play. It isn\'t a very large gate- even when fully extended, it covers an area only about the size of a medium to large playpen. But it offers enough space to keep one or two kids (and their toys) safely occupied.Superyard XT holds up well and I have left it outside during harsh weather conditions with no problems. It is very easy to clean and to transport. The panels fold together and the carrying strap makes the job even easier still. The panels do not fold completely flat- they do have some thickness, so don\'t expect this gate to fit into a tiny space. It needs at least enough space to accommodate the thickness when all six panels are folded together.The panels on Superyard XT are not very tall and because of this, the gate is good only for toddlers and other kids up to about two years of age. As children get older, they will be able to climb over the walls of the gate or possibly knock it down, making it impractical as a containment device. But the shorter height has one clear advantage: It makes it easy for parents because it can be stepped over. There is no need to dissemble the panels or open the gate to get inside.Superyard XT is solid and sturdy but consumers must be careful to position it properly. The gates cannot be placed in a straight line because the design of the gate diminishes its effectiveness when used in this manner. Each one of the joints has to be bent in order to become sturdy. Placed in a straight line, the gate cannot resist pressure and it will fall over with the slightest push.The only complaint I have with Superyard XT is the small space it covers. With the limited space, some people may have difficulty fitting even two kids inside the closed walls of the gate. Depending on the number of toys your kids have, one child might be all that will fit. This is why I strongly recommend purchasing an extension kit. This kit consists of two additional panels and while this doesn\'t sound like much, it increases the area substantially and it makes the gate capable of handling two kids with no problems.Overall, Superyard XT is a very good gate for child or pet containment. I brushed it off when I first saw it because it seemed like another useless product with limited use, marketed solely to take our hard earned money. But now that I own the Superyard, I cannot imagine life without this containment device.

1154,Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I have 6 month old twins and just got this Superyard two weeks ago.  It\'s great. I had not seen anything else like it on the market for this price.  Since I have twins all other play yards just weren\'t going to be big enough, but this one is, especially with the extension kit, so they don\'t feel confined. I can even get in with them and play.  The Superyard XT keeps my babies from rolling or crawling away into danger.  I put a blanket on the floor and let the babies play.Just remember although its sturdy heavy molded plastic, it is still just plastic.

1263,Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I\'m really not sure why so many people writing the review for this product are a.) being incredibly elitist about it vs. the older product by Embryonics that no longer exists and b.) complaining about the sound quality.Perhaps some of these parents expected the toy to be extremely loud and obnoxious like some Tickle Me Elmo doll, but I personally don\'t have a problem with the sound quality. Since it is made for close contact/play, it makes sense that this product wouldn\'t be so loud that I could hear it a mile away. And to be honest, the sound quality really isn\'t bad at all for what it is.This toy is very colorful and my son (who is only just turning 4 months old), while not really interested in toys yet, holds a fascination for listening to this thing make its noises. If I put it at his feet, he will kick it just to make it turn on. He really seems to enjoy it, even if he doesn\'t have quite enough strength yet to really push the buttons on his own. The construction seems pretty solid (I would almost be afraid that my kid could brain himself with this item if he were strong enough to pick it up) and it came included with batteries already installed.Children have the option of pushing one side of the cube to listen to it or adding in the sounds from other sides to create a cacophony of sound. There is also, of course, the orchestra button. If you push the button twice, it turns that particular instrument off so you can hear the other instruments. It lights up but I kind of wish it lit up more as you can barely see it in well-lit rooms.About the only complaint I really have is that some of the instruments don\'t sound anything like what the represented instrument should sound like. The violin for example sounds suspiciously like an oboe and the piano sounds remarkably like a harpsichord. However, I am not so elitist that I wouldn\'t let my kid play with this because the sounds are different than what I would expect them to be. I realize that most people cannot discern the differences in the sounds of like instruments in most cases unless they have had a background in music education, so it\'s really not a big deal. If he enjoys it, then that is ultimately what matters.However, I am giving this product 4 out of 5 stars because of this discrepancy as well as the fact that the French horn (while also sounding off) sounds really, really weak compared to the other instruments on the cube. The other instruments seem very clear and concise and yet, I can barely hear the French horn.But, my son seems to enjoy it so far (and as I mentioned, he doesn\'t seem to care much for toys yet) and to me, that is worth the money in the end.",4,"i\'m realli not sure whi so mani peopl write the review for thi product are a.) be incred elitist about it vs. the older product by embryon that no longer exist and b.) complain about the sound quality.perhap some of these parent expect the toy to be extrem loud and obnoxi like some tickl me elmo doll, but i person don\'t have a problem with the sound quality. sinc it is made for close contact/play, it make sens that thi product wouldn\'t be so loud that i could hear it a mile away. and to be honest, the sound qualiti realli isn\'t bad at all for what it is.thi toy is veri color and my son (who is onli just turn 4 month old), while not realli interest in toy yet, hold a fascin for listen to thi thing make it noises. if i put it at hi feet, he will kick it just to make it turn on. he realli seem to enjoy it, even if he doesn\'t have quit enough strength yet to realli push the button on hi own. the construct seem pretti solid (i would almost be afraid that my kid could brain himself with thi item if he were strong enough to pick it up) and it came includ with batteri alreadi installed.children have the option of push one side of the cube to listen to it or ad in the sound from other side to creat a cacophoni of sound. there is also, of course, the orchestra button. if you push the button twice, it turn that particular instrument off so you can hear the other instruments. it light up but i kind of wish it lit up more as you can bare see it in well-lit rooms.about the onli complaint i realli have is that some of the instrument don\'t sound anyth like what the repres instrument should sound like. the violin for exampl sound suspici like an obo and the piano sound remark like a harpsichord. however, i am not so elitist that i wouldn\'t let my kid play with thi becaus the sound are differ than what i would expect them to be. i realiz that most peopl cannot discern the differ in the sound of like instrument in most case unless they have had a background in music education, so it\' realli not a big deal. if he enjoy it, then that is ultim what matters.however, i am give thi product 4 out of 5 star becaus of thi discrep as well as the fact that the french horn (while also sound off) sound really, realli weak compar to the other instrument on the cube. the other instrument seem veri clear and concis and yet, i can bare hear the french horn.but, my son seem to enjoy it so far (and as i mentioned, he doesn\'t seem to care much for toy yet) and to me, that is worth the money in the end."

What\'s more educational than good music for a baby?  The six sides include five instruments (flute, french horn, harp, piano, & violin) and the orchestra which plays all five together.  What I love is that the instruments can be played separately, or together depending on which ones you touch.  You can start one, and then when you press the second it joins the first.2.  Portable and Safe.  We loved the smallish size and took the cube with us on planes, car rides, and into restaurants.  No sharp edges, no metal.  Each corner is covered in a firm rubber (which is also good for chewing on...).  Not heavy so if it falls on your little one, no tears.  Although light weight, the cube is sturdy and firm enough for your little one to use as a base to lean on.  Our baby used the cube not only to lean on, but also to help her stand up.3.  Easy to Use, Good for parents.  The cube is one piece, no complicated set-up, and takes just two easy-to-find AA batteries.  There is also an on/off switch which is useful when traveling to prevent the music from playing continually in your luggage bag.  The music is NOT annoying, nor particually loud.

Love Love LoveOnly down side is the flute and violin sound a lot like eachother.,5,thi toy is great! 1 year old son got it as a gift and realli enjoy it. he like to throw thing and ha not done ani damag to it yet. it ha rubber corner so for now my floor are ok too. you can press a side of the cube and it will add a new instrament to the mix without restart the music. i hate when toy start someth new the second your child touch it. thi one dosn\'t stop until the song is done unless you touch each instrament play a 2nd time to turn it off. love love loveonli down side is the flute and violin sound a lot like eachother.
1371,Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I purchased this for my special needs grandson who is 4. He loves toys that light up and make sound. It is difficult to find ones that he can easily operate and manipulate with his limited abilities. This fits his needs perfectly.The quality is very good, and I got a good price on it. Product is durable, so when he drops it from his wheelchair, it\'s not a big deal. I would highly recommend this toy for small children and older special needs children.",5,"i purchas thi for my special need grandson who is 4. he love toy that light up and make sound. it is difficult to find one that he can easili oper and manipul with hi limit abilities. thi fit hi need perfectly.th qualiti is veri good, and i got a good price on it. product is durable, so when he drop it from hi wheelchair, it\' not a big deal. i would highli recommend thi toy for small children and older special need children."

1374,Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter got this for Christmas when she was about 6 mos old.  She rarely ever plays with it.  She was slightly amused with this toy for a month or two.  She never plays with it now.  When she did show interest in it, it only lasted a few moments.  The music does get a little annoying because my daughter liked it when all instruments would play at the same time.  Nothing special about this toy and it\'s loud.  Would not recommend.",2,"my daughter got thi for christma when she wa about 6 mo old. she rare ever play with it. she wa slightli amus with thi toy for a month or two. she never play with it now. when she did show interest in it, it onli last a few moments. the music doe get a littl annoy becaus my daughter like it when all instrument would play at the same time. noth special about thi toy and it\' loud. would not recommend."
